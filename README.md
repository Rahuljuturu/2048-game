### Project Description: 2048 Game with Pygame

**Overview**:
The project implements the classic 2048 game using Python and the Pygame library. In the 2048 game, players slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game continues until the grid is full and no more moves can be made.

**Functionality**:
- **Game Grid**: The game features a grid of tiles where each tile has a numeric value.
- **User Input**: Players can use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to slide tiles in the corresponding direction.
- **Tile Merging**: When two tiles with the same value collide as a result of a move, they merge into a single tile with their values added together.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the values of merged tiles.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the grid is full and no more moves can be made.

**Implementation**:
- **Pygame Library**: The game is built using the Pygame library, which provides functionalities for graphics rendering, user input handling, and animation.
- **Tiles Class**: A `Tiles` class is defined to represent individual tiles on the game grid. Each tile has attributes such as its value, position on the grid, and color.
- **Drawing Functions**: Functions are implemented to draw the game grid, tiles, and user interface elements using Pygame's drawing capabilities.
- **Game Logic**: Logic is implemented to handle user input, move tiles on the grid, merge tiles when they collide, update the game state, and check for game over conditions.


**Features**:
- **Simple and Intuitive Gameplay**: The game offers simple and intuitive gameplay suitable for players of all ages.
- **Colorful Graphics**: The game features colorful graphics and smooth animations using Pygame's rendering capabilities.
- **Score Tracking**: Players can track their progress and achievements through the game's score tracking system.

This project provides an enjoyable gaming experience while also serving as a learning opportunity for Python programming and game development with Pygame.
